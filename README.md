# College Diversity’s Relationship with the Workforce
## *TEAM: Kristy Anderson, Cullen Andrews, Daniel Carter, and George Simon*
### SCOPE
Our project is to uncover insights surrounding education, diversity, and income changes in the United States. We will examine relationships between college graduate’s diversity data and income census data over the time periods of 2011-2014 and 2014-2018.
### HYPOTHESIS
Null Hypothesis -- States where the three largest public universities saw an increase proportion of students enrolled of (race) over the time periods of 2011-2014 and 2014-2018 had the same increase in median income for that race in states where the three largest public universities had no increase in enrollment.
Alternative Hypothesis -- Median income increase for (race) was different in states where enrollment for (race) increased at the three largest public universities.

Additional Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis -- changes in median income for (race) as a function of overall average state income are the same for all races.   
Alternative Hypothesis -- different races have different changes in income switching between states with different overall average income.

### DESCRIPTION
We will use data from the U.S. Department of Education, which is in the form of large .csv files. We will research documentation to interpret what the data represents. We will investigate the data set to identify which data pertains to diversity, loan payments, and graduate jobs. We may find that there is no useful data in the jobs category for this particular set, but the data must be cleaned to illustrate that this is the case.

### RESEARCH QUESTIONS
* Over the time periods of 2011-2014 and 2014-2018, is there noteworthy trends in median income and diversity enrollment universities?
* How has the racial population diversity in the U.S. changed from 2011-2014 to 2014-2018?
* Is there statistical significance between student diversity and median income in the U.S.?
* Are there trends between college diversity and student loan payments?
* What does diversity look like between the different categories of colleges? (e.g. 2-year vs 4-year, private vs public, etc)

### DATASETS
* Data:  https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/ (columns labeled UGDS & C150)
* Data:  [Census Data API Guide](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/data/developers/api-user-guide/api-guide.pdf)
    * [Census API Variables](https://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs5/variables.html)

### DATA ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS
* Based on how the data was cleaned and from what was availabe four races were chosen for analysis
    * Hispanic & Latino
    * Black
    * Asian
    * White
* Data was pulled for the below three years in both the Census Data and College Score Card Data
    * 2011
    * 2014
    * 2018
